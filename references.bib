  abstract = {The field of missing data analysis has evolved quickly; outdated strategies have been replaced by missing data procedures that make use of partial data to provide unbiased and efficient parameter estimates. Here, we describe an eight-step process for performing basic missing data procedures (single and multiple imputation) using NORM (Version 2.03; Schafer, 1997) and SAS (Version 9.2; SAS, 2011a). We make use of the automation utility, MIAutomate, to facilitate the analysis of NORM-imputed data with SPSS. We also perform a basic multiple regression to compare the performance of the following five missing data approaches: (1) complete cases analysis, (2) mean substitution, (3) FIML-based Amos, (4) multiple imputation with no auxiliary variables (MI), and (5) multiple imputation with auxiliary variables (MI+). Mean substitution showed clear bias in parameter estimates. Although the complete cases model yielded parameter estimates similar to those obtained with MI and FIML, the standard errors were consistently larger because the estimation was based on fewer cases. The MI and FIML models yielded reasonably unbiased estimates of the b-weights; however, they had noticeably lower t-values compared to the MI+ analysis. Based on prior research and the empirical results shown in this chapter, including auxiliary variables to the missing data model that are highly correlated with variables containing missingness is a good way to reduce the standard errors of estimated parameters. The prescribed missing data procedures will always perform at least as well as more traditional approaches (e.g., complete cases analysis), and in most circumstances, there will be a clear advantage of the prescribed procedures, in terms of estimation bias and/or statistical power. Useful and accessible missing data procedures are now an integral part of many mainstream statistical packages, making it increasingly difficult to justify not using them.},

  abstract = {Big game hunting is the most popular type of hunting in the United States, and deer and elk hunting are the most popular type of hunting in Montana. Similar to other states, deer and elk hunting also generates most of the revenue spent on wildlife conservation by the state of Montana. Although nationwide trends indicate a concerning decline in hunter participation, the trends in license sales and hunter participation within most states have not received as much attention. We investigated trends in resident deer and elk license sales in Montana using existing licensing databases. We then estimated hunter recruitment, hunter participation, and license purchasing probabilities using hunter education and licensing databases. We employed a multi-state mark-recapture model and 248,819 records of deer and elk license purchasing habits for individual Montana residents during 2002-2007. We used matrix population models to examine the relative influence of these parameters on trends in license sales and hunter participation. Resident deer and elk license sales increased 4\% in Montana during 2002-2007. We found that males had greater recruitment rates, retention rates, and license purchasing probabilities than females, and that young adults had lesser license purchasing probabilities than other age classes. Based on analyses of matrix population models, trends in license sales in Montana are most influenced by middle-aged and baby boomer male license purchase probabilities. Trends in hunter participation are positively influenced by recruitment and retention in all male age classes, with the smallest predicted effects arising from recruitment of young adult males. Our results suggest that a focus on older age class males with programs designed to increase hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchase probabilities may have similar or larger effects on trends in license sales and hunter participation in Montana than programs directed at youth. Our analyses also provide a framework by which trends in hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchasing habits can be objectively quantified in order to inform and evaluate hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchase habit programs.},

Information provided by states on their requirements for hunter education allowed us to determine whether people were required to take an education course before they could purchase a hunting license. We estimated the effect of hunter-education requirements on hunting participation, controlling for the person's age, sex, and race/ethnicity, as well as for the percentage of the state's population living in rural areas and the regional level of hunting participation in 1955 (as a surrogate for hunting culture). In 1980, 23 states with no hunter-education requirement had an overall hunting participation rate of 12\%, while participation in states with a hunter-education requirement for all hunters was 6\%. States with requirements were, however, more urban and had lower participation rates in 1955. When the individual and state-level factors associated with hunter participation are controlled statistically, the difference in participation was less than 1\% (p {$<$} .01) for persons required or not required to take a hunter-education course. Hunter education also reduces first-time hunting rates for persons age 16 and older. Individual-level measures of residence and hunting culture, were they available, might further reduce estimated effects of hunter-education requirements. Estimates of hunter-education effects on hunting are for national-level data and may not apply to particular states' hunter-education programs.},

This conservation paradigm arose out of a movement, lead by prominent hunters, to stop over-exploitation of wildlife by market hunters and the desire to have wildlife accessible to all people. Since then, hunters have contributed billions of dollars to wildlife management that benefit countless wildlife species. These funds support wildlife management agencies which manage all wildlife species, not just those that are hunted. This unique and successful conservation paradigm is responsible for supporting a wide variety of conservation activities, including law enforcement, research, information and education, habitat management and acquisition, as well as wildlife population restoration and management. Although wildlife conservation activities embrace far more than the hunted species, hunters continue to be the primary agents of financial support, management assistance and organized advocacy.},

Institutional reform is inherently slow. Limitations resulting from historical and resource dependencies between state wildlife agencies and hunters have left the Institution poorly positioned to meet changing ecological and social complexities. In this paper, we suggest that an ideal Institution would have the following 4 components: broad-based funding, trustee-based governance, multidisciplinary science as the basis of recommendations from professional staff, and involvement of diverse stakeholders and partners. Our suggestions reflect the fundamental tenets of the Public Trust Doctrine, which we believe is the foundation of the Institution. In bringing forth these ideas, we hope to encourage discussion about how the Institution should reform to meet the changing needs of society.},

Results of our mail survey showed that the samples were similar in age, gender, and ethnicity, but Pennsylvania respondents were more likely to have lived their entire lives in the state and had spent more of their adult lives in rural areas. On the other hand, Pennsylvania respondents were less likely to have attended school beyond high school. Pennsylvania respondents hunted more frequently and were more likely to gather wild foods. Colorado respondents were more likely to fish, and they participated in more nonconsumptive activities. Education, rural/urban differences, and residential stability had a limited ability to predict differences in consumptive activities. Age, education, and residential stability predicted differences in nonconsumptive activities. Results suggest that cultural differences between regions may be more important than socio-demographic characteristics for understanding of outdoor recreation patterns in the past, present, and future.},

Respondents were classified as active hunters, former hunters, or nonhunters. Active hunters were relatively satisfied with their recent hunting experiences and the wildlife management programs conducted by the state. In addition, they were supportive of a modest increase of hunting fees. Reasons given by former hunters for quitting the activity were lack of time, lack of public hunting areas, aging, and loss of interest. Nonhunters either did not have an interest in hunting or considered the killing of animals as cruel. Reasons for lack of participation by nonhunters do not indicate a high probability of recruiting hunters from the ranks of nonhunters. These results suggest that agencies and organizations that depend on hunters should put resources into keeping active hunters from becoming former hunters. Based on the results and comments from active and former hunters, it would seem that the best mechanisms for hunter retention are to provide opportunities for active hunters to participate in hunting and to keep hunting woven into the social fabric of community.},

  abstract = {This article documents the magnitude of and factors associated with declining hunting license sales in Alabama. Respondents were classified as active hunters, former hunters, or nonhunters. Active hunters were relatively satisfied with their recent hunting experiences and the wildlife management programs conducted by the state. In addition, they were supportive of a modest increase of hunting fees. Reasons given by former hunters for quitting the activity were lack of time, lack of public hunting areas, aging, and loss of interest. Nonhunters either did not have an interest in hunting or considered the killing of animals as cruel. Reasons for lack of participation by nonhunters do not indicate a high probability of recruiting hunters from the ranks of nonhunters. These results suggest that agencies and organizations that depend on hunters should put resources into keeping active hunters from becoming former hunters. Based on the results and comments from active and former hunters, it would seem that the best mechanisms for hunter retention are to provide opportunities for active hunters to participate in hunting and to keep hunting woven into the social fabric of community.},

  abstract = {Environmentalists who believe that hunters and anglers are interested only in the kill and the catch may be surprised to learn that sportsmen were originally in the vanguard of the conservation movement. John Reiger's work has been hailed as an authoritative look at these early conservationists; now his landmark book is available in an expanded edition that broadens its historic sweep.  Beginning in the 1870s, sportsmen across America formed hundreds of organizations that not only fostered responsibility for game habitats but also spearheaded the creation of national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. Reiger tells how these "gentlemen" hunters and anglers, outdoor journals like Forest and Stream, and organizations such as the Boone and Crockett Club\textemdash founded by Theodore Roosevelt, George Bird Grinnell, and other prominent sportsmen\textemdash lobbied for laws regulating the taking of wildlife, and helped to arouse public interest in wilderness preservation.  In this new edition, Reiger traces the antecedents of the sportsmen's conservation movement to the years before the Civil War. He extends his coverage into the present by demonstrating how the nineteenth-century sportsman's code\textemdash with its demand for taking responsibility for the total environment\textemdash continues to be the cornerstone of the sporting ethic. A new Epilogue depicts leading environmental thinker Aldo Leopold as the best-known exponent of this hunter-conservationist ideal.  Praised as "one of the seminal works in conservation history" by historian Hal Rothman, Reiger's book continues to be essential reading for all concerned with how earlier Americans regarded the land, demonstrating even to those who oppose hunting that they share with sportsmen and sportswomen an awareness and appreciation of our fragile environment.},

This article shows that the number of waterfowl harvested in the United States is related to the abundance of waterfowl wintering in Mexico. On average, this flow of ecosystem services annually yields US\$ 4.68 million in hunting stamp sales in the western United States. A demand curve, fitted to duck hunting licenses as a function of stamp price and previous-year waterfowl harvest, estimated US\$3\textendash 6 million in consumer surplus produced in addition to governmental stamp sales revenue. This strongly suggests that waterfowl wintering habitat in western Mexico is economically valuable to U.S. hunters. Because hunters may benefit substantially from these habitats they may be willing to pay for conservation efforts in western Mexico that can result in transnational benefits received in the United States.},

Relatively scant empirical information is available to game managers on the statistical determinants of lottery applications for elk hunting privileges, and what is available does not distinguish between groups. Given the count nature of lottery applications (i.e., non-negative integers), we use a statistical technique that is designed to accommodate such data: the negative binomial regression model. Results indicate that changes in hunt characteristics either simultaneously increase or decrease applications across groups, with the exception of bow hunts. Also of note, bow hunts and mature bull hunts are statistically significant determinants of lottery applications for nonresidents and especially so for guided nonresidents.},

To address options to bolster wildlife agency profit from the sale of hunting licenses, we developed a stage-based, stochastic population model of a hunter population, and demonstrate its utility within a decision-making framework to inform state wildlife agency decisions. We evaluated hypothetical youth and adult recruitment-focused outreach programs over 10 years to increase license sale profit. Using our model as the core of a decision analysis, state agencies can set hunter population or license profit targets, and evaluate management actions designed to achieve those objectives. We expect that our approach will provide a valuable framework for anticipating the future of hunting and hunting-generated conservation funds, and can be extended to other user groups, including target shooters and anglers.},

  abstract = {This paper employs a cohort analysis to examine the recent decline in the number of deer hunters in the State of Wisconsin and considers the implications of hunter decline for wildlife management and conservation. North American natural resource management strategies currently depend on hunters and anglers to fund habitat conservation, wildlife management, and land protection through license fees and special taxes on hunting equipment. However, hunter participation is declining across the United States, challenging the long-term viability of this approach. We undertake an age-period-cohort (APC) approach to analyze hunter participation rates and introduce an APC method to project the future number of hunters in Wisconsin. We find that if the recent patterns continue, the number of Wisconsin male deer hunters will decline by more than 10~\% (55,304 hunters) in the next 10~years and an additional 18~\% (88,552 hunters) between 2020 and 2030.},

  abstract = {Hunting license sales have declined in many U.S. states over recent decades, and efforts are underway to recruit new hunters. Research suggests socioeconomic status influences hunting participation and license sales. A limited number of studies, however, actually connect socioeconomic status and license sales on an aggregated community level or spatial context. This article examined relationships between socioeconomic factors and hunting license sales in Cook County, Illinois. A principal component analysis is used to create indices aggregating census tract socioeconomic indicators. Spatial and statistical analyses using both linear regression and multinomial logistic regression explored relationships between indices and percentage of license sales for each census tract. Spatial correlation and quantitative relationships were found between the indices and hunting license sales. Models developed through this study may provide current state hunter recruitment programs with an understanding of the interaction of socioeconomic factors and hunting license sales.},
