	abstract = {Recent journalism and scholarship have noted a years-long decline in Americans' participation in rural forms of outdoor recreation such as hunting. While some attempt has been made to understand these declines few have analyzed the causes of these changes in a theoretically rigorous empirical manner. This study addresses this issue in two empirical approaches. First, we analyze survey data on hunting and various theoretical predictors from the General Social Survey. Second, we statistically analyze changes in hunting license acquisitions at the state level for a period of several years. We empirically test the Videophilia hypothesis (Pergams \& Zaradic, 2006) as one explanation positing a substitution effect involving electronic forms of indoor entertainment. We find evidence that the switch to certain kinds of electronic entertainment as well as the growth in urban living explain the decline in hunting and discuss the implications of these findings and future directions for research.},

	abstract = {Big game hunting is the most popular type of hunting in the United States, and deer and elk hunting are the most popular type of hunting in Montana. Similar to other states, deer and elk hunting also generates most of the revenue spent on wildlife conservation by the state of Montana. Although nationwide trends indicate a concerning decline in hunter participation, the trends in license sales and hunter participation within most states have not received as much attention. We investigated trends in resident deer and elk license sales in Montana using existing licensing databases. We then estimated hunter recruitment, hunter participation, and license purchasing probabilities using hunter education and licensing databases. We employed a multi-state mark-recapture model and 248,819 records of deer and elk license purchasing habits for individual Montana residents during 2002-2007. We used matrix population models to examine the relative influence of these parameters on trends in license sales and hunter participation. Resident deer and elk license sales increased 4\% in Montana during 2002-2007. We found that males had greater recruitment rates, retention rates, and license purchasing probabilities than females, and that young adults had lesser license purchasing probabilities than other age classes. Based on analyses of matrix population models, trends in license sales in Montana are most influenced by middle-aged and baby boomer male license purchase probabilities. Trends in hunter participation are positively influenced by recruitment and retention in all male age classes, with the smallest predicted effects arising from recruitment of young adult males. Our results suggest that a focus on older age class males with programs designed to increase hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchase probabilities may have similar or larger effects on trends in license sales and hunter participation in Montana than programs directed at youth. Our analyses also provide a framework by which trends in hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchasing habits can be objectively quantified in order to inform and evaluate hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchase habit programs.},

Results of our mail survey showed that the samples were similar in age, gender, and ethnicity, but Pennsylvania respondents were more likely to have lived their entire lives in the state and had spent more of their adult lives in rural areas. On the other hand, Pennsylvania respondents were less likely to have attended school beyond high school. Pennsylvania respondents hunted more frequently and were more likely to gather wild foods. Colorado respondents were more likely to fish, and they participated in more nonconsumptive activities. Education, rural/urban differences, and residential stability had a limited ability to predict differences in consumptive activities. Age, education, and residential stability predicted differences in nonconsumptive activities. Results suggest that cultural differences between regions may be more important than socio-demographic characteristics for understanding of outdoor recreation patterns in the past, present, and future.},

	abstract = {This article documents the magnitude of and factors associated with declining hunting license sales in Alabama. Respondents were classified as active hunters, former hunters, or nonhunters. Active hunters were relatively satisfied with their recent hunting experiences and the wildlife management programs conducted by the state. In addition, they were supportive of a modest increase of hunting fees. Reasons given by former hunters for quitting the activity were lack of time, lack of public hunting areas, aging, and loss of interest. Nonhunters either did not have an interest in hunting or considered the killing of animals as cruel. Reasons for lack of participation by nonhunters do not indicate a high probability of recruiting hunters from the ranks of nonhunters. These results suggest that agencies and organizations that depend on hunters should put resources into keeping active hunters from becoming former hunters. Based on the results and comments from active and former hunters, it would seem that the best mechanisms for hunter retention are to provide opportunities for active hunters to participate in hunting and to keep hunting woven into the social fabric of community.},

  abstract = {Environmentalists who believe that hunters and anglers are interested only in the kill and the catch may be surprised to learn that sportsmen were originally in the vanguard of the conservation movement. John Reiger's work has been hailed as an authoritative look at these early conservationists; now his landmark book is available in an expanded edition that broadens its historic sweep.  Beginning in the 1870s, sportsmen across America formed hundreds of organizations that not only fostered responsibility for game habitats but also spearheaded the creation of national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. Reiger tells how these {"}gentlemen{"} hunters and anglers, outdoor journals like Forest and Stream, and organizations such as the Boone and Crockett Club—founded by Theodore Roosevelt, George Bird Grinnell, and other prominent sportsmen—lobbied for laws regulating the taking of wildlife, and helped to arouse public interest in wilderness preservation.  In this new edition, Reiger traces the antecedents of the sportsmen's conservation movement to the years before the Civil War. He extends his coverage into the present by demonstrating how the nineteenth-century sportsman's code—with its demand for taking responsibility for the total environment—continues to be the cornerstone of the sporting ethic. A new Epilogue depicts leading environmental thinker Aldo Leopold as the best-known exponent of this hunter-conservationist ideal.  Praised as {"}one of the seminal works in conservation history{"} by historian Hal Rothman, Reiger's book continues to be essential reading for all concerned with how earlier Americans regarded the land, demonstrating even to those who oppose hunting that they share with sportsmen and sportswomen an awareness and appreciation of our fragile environment.},

  abstract = {The field of missing data analysis has evolved quickly; outdated strategies have been replaced by missing data procedures that make use of partial data to provide unbiased and efficient parameter estimates. Here, we describe an eight-step process for performing basic missing data procedures (single and multiple imputation) using NORM (Version 2.03; Schafer, 1997) and SAS (Version 9.2; SAS, 2011a). We make use of the automation utility, MIAutomate, to facilitate the analysis of NORM-imputed data with SPSS. We also perform a basic multiple regression to compare the performance of the following five missing data approaches: (1) complete cases analysis, (2) mean substitution, (3) FIML-based Amos, (4) multiple imputation with no auxiliary variables (MI), and (5) multiple imputation with auxiliary variables (MI+). Mean substitution showed clear bias in parameter estimates. Although the complete cases model yielded parameter estimates similar to those obtained with MI and FIML, the standard errors were consistently larger because the estimation was based on fewer cases. The MI and FIML models yielded reasonably unbiased estimates of the b-weights; however, they had noticeably lower t-values compared to the MI+ analysis. Based on prior research and the empirical results shown in this chapter, including auxiliary variables to the missing data model that are highly correlated with variables containing missingness is a good way to reduce the standard errors of estimated parameters. The prescribed missing data procedures will always perform at least as well as more traditional approaches (e.g., complete cases analysis), and in most circumstances, there will be a clear advantage of the prescribed procedures, in terms of estimation bias and/or statistical power. Useful and accessible missing data procedures are now an integral part of many mainstream statistical packages, making it increasingly difficult to justify not using them.},
