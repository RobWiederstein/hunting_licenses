Since then the intense public interest in wildlife law has been reflected in a tremendous growth in both litigation and new legislation. This, the third edition, thoroughly revises and updates the earlier edition in light of current legal perspectives on the conservation of wildlife and biological diversity.Two decades after its first publication, this book remains the standard reference for anyone seeking to understand the statutes, regulations, and court decisions governing wildlife law.

Data for the study were obtained from a telephone survey of 3,000 Texas residents sampled from the general population conducted in 1998. Descriptive analysis revealed that about one-third (30.3\%) of the sample purchased some type of fishing license; 18.5\% held a hunting license. Results from logistic regression analyses were consistent with previous literature on relationships between sociodemographic variables and hunting and fishing participation. Gender and race were the most consistent predictors of license purchases. Hispanic respondents and African-Americans were significantly less likely to have purchased any type of fishing and hunting license. The significant effects associated with Hispanic ethnic background and African-American ethnic background were observed controlling for the effects of age, gender, education, income, and place of residence. The study concluded by acknowledging some strategic implications associated with demographic change in addition to identifying future research needs.},

From 1972 to 1992 high school girls narrowed the gap with boys in math and science course taking and in achievement test scores. These variables, which we term the proximate determinants, can account for 30 to 60 percent of the relative increase in women's college completion rate. Behind these changes were several others: the future work expectations of young women increased greatly between 1968 and 1979 and the age at first marriage for college graduate women rose by 2.5 years in the 1970s, allowing them to be more serious students. The reversal of the college gender gap, rather than just its elimination, was due in part to the persistence of behavioral and developmental differences between males and females.},

  abstract = {The field of missing data analysis has evolved quickly; outdated strategies have been replaced by missing data procedures that make use of partial data to provide unbiased and efficient parameter estimates. Here, we describe an eight-step process for performing basic missing data procedures (single and multiple imputation) using NORM (Version 2.03; Schafer, 1997) and SAS (Version 9.2; SAS, 2011a). We make use of the automation utility, MIAutomate, to facilitate the analysis of NORM-imputed data with SPSS. We also perform a basic multiple regression to compare the performance of the following five missing data approaches: (1) complete cases analysis, (2) mean substitution, (3) FIML-based Amos, (4) multiple imputation with no auxiliary variables (MI), and (5) multiple imputation with auxiliary variables (MI+). Mean substitution showed clear bias in parameter estimates. Although the complete cases model yielded parameter estimates similar to those obtained with MI and FIML, the standard errors were consistently larger because the estimation was based on fewer cases. The MI and FIML models yielded reasonably unbiased estimates of the b-weights; however, they had noticeably lower t-values compared to the MI+ analysis. Based on prior research and the empirical results shown in this chapter, including auxiliary variables to the missing data model that are highly correlated with variables containing missingness is a good way to reduce the standard errors of estimated parameters. The prescribed missing data procedures will always perform at least as well as more traditional approaches (e.g., complete cases analysis), and in most circumstances, there will be a clear advantage of the prescribed procedures, in terms of estimation bias and/or statistical power. Useful and accessible missing data procedures are now an integral part of many mainstream statistical packages, making it increasingly difficult to justify not using them.},

Similar to other states, deer and elk hunting also generates most of the revenue spent on wildlife conservation by the state of Montana. Although nationwide trends indicate a concerning decline in hunter participation, the trends in license sales and hunter participation within most states have not received as much attention. We investigated trends in resident deer and elk license sales in Montana using existing licensing databases. We then estimated hunter recruitment, hunter participation, and license purchasing probabilities using hunter education and licensing databases. We employed a multi-state mark-recapture model and 248,819 records of deer and elk license purchasing habits for individual Montana residents during 2002-2007. We used matrix population models to examine the relative influence of these parameters on trends in license sales and hunter participation. Resident deer and elk license sales increased 4\% in Montana during 2002-2007. We found that males had greater recruitment rates, retention rates, and license purchasing probabilities than females, and that young adults had lesser license purchasing probabilities than other age classes. Based on analyses of matrix population models, trends in license sales in Montana are most influenced by middle-aged and baby boomer male license purchase probabilities. Trends in hunter participation are positively influenced by recruitment and retention in all male age classes, with the smallest predicted effects arising from recruitment of young adult males. Our results suggest that a focus on older age class males with programs designed to increase hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchase probabilities may have similar or larger effects on trends in license sales and hunter participation in Montana than programs directed at youth. Our analyses also provide a framework by which trends in hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchasing habits can be objectively quantified in order to inform and evaluate hunter recruitment, retention, and license purchase habit programs.]},

  abstract = {The effects of required hunter‐education programs on hunter recruitment and participation were examined using the 1980, 1985, and 1990 screener surveys from the U.S. National Surveys of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife‐Associated Recreation. Information provided by states on their requirements for hunter education allowed us to determine whether people were required to take an education course before they could purchase a hunting license. We estimated the effect of hunter‐education requirements on hunting participation, controlling for the person's age, sex, and race/ethnicity, as well as for the percentage of the state's population living in rural areas and the regional level of hunting participation in 1955 (as a surrogate for hunting culture). In 1980, 23 states with no hunter‐education requirement had an overall hunting participation rate of 12\%, while participation in states with a hunter‐education requirement for all hunters was 6\%. States with requirements were, however, more urban and had lower participation rates in 1955. When the individual and state‐level factors associated with hunter participation are controlled statistically, the difference in participation was less than 1\% (p {$<$} .01) for persons required or not required to take a hunter‐education course. Hunter education also reduces first‐time hunting rates for persons age 16 and older. Individual‐level measures of residence and hunting culture, were they available, might further reduce estimated effects of hunter‐education requirements. Estimates of hunter‐education effects on hunting are for national‐level data and may not apply to particular states’ hunter‐education programs.},

  abstract = {Regulated hunting is the foundation of the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation. This conservation paradigm arose out of a movement, lead by prominent hunters, to stop over-exploitation of wildlife by market hunters and the desire to have wildlife accessible to all people. Since then, hunters have contributed billions of dollars to wildlife management that benefit countless wildlife species. These funds support wildlife management agencies which manage all wildlife species, not just those that are hunted. This unique and successful conservation paradigm is responsible for supporting a wide variety of conservation activities, including law enforcement, research, information and education, habitat management and acquisition, as well as wildlife population restoration and management. Although wildlife conservation activities embrace far more than the hunted species, hunters continue to be the primary agents of financial support, management assistance and organized advocacy.},

Students who fail to reach this critical milestone often falter in the later grades and drop out before earning a high school diploma. This study relies on a unique national database of 3,975 students born between 1979 and 1989. The children's parents were surveyed every two years to determine the family's economic status and other factors, while the children's reading progress was tracked using the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) Reading Recognition subtest. The database reports whether students have finished high school by age 19, but does not indicate whether they actually dropped out. For purposes of this study, the researchers divided the children into three reading groups which correspond roughly to the skill levels used in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): proficient, basic and below basic. The children were also separated into three income categories: those who have never been poor, those who spent some time in poverty and those who have lived more than half the years surveyed in poverty. The findings include: (1) One in six children who are not reading proficiently in third grade do not graduate from high school on time, a rate four times greater than that for proficient readers; (2) The rates are highest for the low, below-basic readers: 23 percent of these children drop out or fail to finish high school on time, compared to 9 percent of children with basic reading skills and 4 percent of proficient readers; (3) Overall, 22 percent of children who have lived in poverty do not graduate from high school, compared to 6 percent of those who have never been poor.

Institutional reform is inherently slow. Limitations resulting from historical and resource dependencies between state wildlife agencies and hunters have left the Institution poorly positioned to meet changing ecological and social complexities. In this paper, we suggest that an ideal Institution would have the following 4 components: broad-based funding, trustee-based governance, multidisciplinary science as the basis of recommendations from professional staff, and involvement of diverse stakeholders and partners. Our suggestions reflect the fundamental tenets of the Public Trust Doctrine, which we believe is the foundation of the Institution. In bringing forth these ideas, we hope to encourage discussion about how the Institution should reform to meet the changing needs of society.},

Using longitudinal data on a nationally representative cohort of eighth grade students in 1988, I examine two potential explanations for the differential attendance rates of men and women -- returns to schooling and non-cognitive skills. The attendance gap is roughly five percentage points for all high school graduates. Conditional on attendance, however, there are few differences in type of college, enrollment status or selectivity of institution. The majority of the attendance gap can be explained by differences in the characteristics of men and women, despite some gender differences in the determinants of college attendance. I find that higher non-cognitive skills and college premiums among women account for nearly 90 percent of the gender gap in higher education. Interestingly, non-cognitive factors continue to influence college enrollment after controlling for high school achievement.},

Results of our mail survey showed that the samples were similar in age, gender, and ethnicity, but Pennsylvania respondents were more likely to have lived their entire lives in the state and had spent more of their adult lives in rural areas. On the other hand, Pennsylvania respondents were less likely to have attended school beyond high school. Pennsylvania respondents hunted more frequently and were more likely to gather wild foods. Colorado respondents were more likely to fish, and they participated in more nonconsumptive activities. Education, rural/urban differences, and residential stability had a limited ability to predict differences in consumptive activities. Age, education, and residential stability predicted differences in nonconsumptive activities.

The only book to integrate social science literature on outdoor recreation, it reviews studies from this broad, interdisciplinary field and synthesizes them into a body of knowledge, providing a historical perspective on outdoor recreation research and developing its practical management implications.This third edition is fully revised to reflect current research and new concerns in the field. A new chapter examines the emerging issue of sense of place and its relationship to outdoor recreation. The book concludes with twenty principles to guide outdoor recreation management and research. An extensive bibliography and section entitled “Notes on Sources: A Guide to the Social Science Literature in Outdoor Recreation” lead readers to valuable primary source material.},

  abstract = {I survey the evidence on patterns in U.S. high school graduation rates over the period 1970-2010 and report the results of new research conducted to fill in holes in the evidence. I begin by pointing out the strengths and limitations of existing data sources. I then describe six striking patterns in graduation rates. They include stagnation over the last three decades of the twentieth century, significant race-, income-, and gender-based gaps, and significant increases in graduation rates over the first decade of the twenty-first century, especially among blacks and Hispanics. I then describe the models economists use to explain the decisions of individuals to invest in schooling, and examine the extent to which the parameters of the models explain recent patterns in graduation rates. I find that increases in the nonmonetary costs of completing high school and the increasing availability of the GED credential help to explain stagnation in the face of substantial gaps between the wages of high school graduates and school dropouts. I point out that there are several hypotheses, but to date, very little evidence to explain the increases in high school graduation rates over the first decade of the twenty-first century. I conclude by reviewing the evidence on effective strategies to increase high school graduation rates, and explaining why the causal evidence is quite modest.},

  abstract = {Environmentalists who believe that hunters and anglers are interested only in the kill and the catch may be surprised to learn that sportsmen were originally in the vanguard of the conservation movement. John Reiger's work has been hailed as an authoritative look at these early conservationists; now his landmark book is available in an expanded edition that broadens its historic sweep.  Beginning in the 1870s, sportsmen across America formed hundreds of organizations that not only fostered responsibility for game habitats but also spearheaded the creation of national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. Reiger tells how these "gentlemen" hunters and anglers, outdoor journals like Forest and Stream, and organizations such as the Boone and Crockett Club—founded by Theodore Roosevelt, George Bird Grinnell, and other prominent sportsmen—lobbied for laws regulating the taking of wildlife, and helped to arouse public interest in wilderness preservation.  In this new edition, Reiger traces the antecedents of the sportsmen's conservation movement to the years before the Civil War. He extends his coverage into the present by demonstrating how the nineteenth-century sportsman's code—with its demand for taking responsibility for the total environment—continues to be the cornerstone of the sporting ethic. A new Epilogue depicts leading environmental thinker Aldo Leopold as the best-known exponent of this hunter-conservationist ideal.  Praised as "one of the seminal works in conservation history" by historian Hal Rothman, Reiger's book continues to be essential reading for all concerned with how earlier Americans regarded the land, demonstrating even to those who oppose hunting that they share with sportsmen and sportswomen an awareness and appreciation of our fragile environment.},

This article shows that the number of waterfowl harvested in the United States is related to the abundance of waterfowl wintering in Mexico. On average, this flow of ecosystem services annually yields US\$ 4.68 million in hunting stamp sales in the western United States. A demand curve, fitted to duck hunting licenses as a function of stamp price and previous-year waterfowl harvest, estimated US\$3–6 million in consumer surplus produced in addition to governmental stamp sales revenue. This strongly suggests that waterfowl wintering habitat in western Mexico is economically valuable to U.S. hunters. Because hunters may benefit substantially from these habitats they may be willing to pay for conservation efforts in western Mexico that can result in transnational benefits received in the United States.},

However, hunting license sales are declining, leading many state wildlife management agencies to re-evaluate funding and management structures. Understanding the mechanisms behind such declines, and diagnosing the persistence of such trends is necessary to anticipate license fund fluctuations. To examine hunter recruitment and retention rates, we analyzed a data set of {$>$}490,000 deer and elk license records from 2002 to 2011 from the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks' Automated Licensing System. We used a temporal symmetry model in a mark-recapture framework to estimate hunter retention, recruitment rates, and population change, and then used population change estimates to forecast future hunter populations. We used covariates of gender, age, residency, and license price to improve model parsimony. Millennial generation hunters increased during the 11-year analysis, and this was driven by high recruitment rates of young hunters, especially women, but recruitment decreased dramatically as youth aged. Because Baby Boomers constitute such a large proportion of the hunting population, decreases in recruitment and retention in this cohort drove declines in the Montana hunter population. Increasing license price decreased the probability of recruiting and retaining hunters. The hunter population was stable until 2006, but has been declining since that time with nearly a 50\% decline in hunter recruitment from 2002 to 2011.]},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to investigate the statistical determinants of lottery applications for New Mexico elk hunting licenses from three different groups: (1) residents, (2) guided nonresidents, and (3) nonguided nonresidents. Relatively scant empirical information is available to game managers on the statistical determinants of lottery applications for elk hunting privileges, and what is available does not distinguish between groups. Given the count nature of lottery applications (i.e., non‐negative integers), we use a statistical technique that is designed to accommodate such data: the negative binomial regression model. Results indicate that changes in hunt characteristics either simultaneously increase or decrease applications across groups, with the exception of bow hunts. Also of note, bow hunts and mature bull hunts are statistically significant determinants of lottery applications for nonresidents and especially so for guided nonresidents.},

To address options to bolster wildlife agency profit from the sale of hunting licenses, we developed a stage-based, stochastic population model of a hunter population, and demonstrate its utility within a decision-making framework to inform state wildlife agency decisions. We evaluated hypothetical youth and adult recruitment-focused outreach programs over 10 years to increase license sale profit. Using our model as the core of a decision analysis, state agencies can set hunter population or license profit targets, and evaluate management actions designed to achieve those objectives. We expect that our approach will provide a valuable framework for anticipating the future of hunting and hunting-generated conservation funds, and can be extended to other user groups, including target shooters and anglers.},

Understanding anglers’ and hunters’ responsiveness to changes in license prices, therefore, is crucial to fish and wildlife agencies’ decisions.},

North American natural resource management strategies currently depend on hunters and anglers to fund habitat conservation, wildlife management, and land protection through license fees and special taxes on hunting equipment. However, hunter participation is declining across the United States, challenging the long-term viability of this approach. We undertake an age-period-cohort (APC) approach to analyze hunter participation rates and introduce an APC method to project the future number of hunters in Wisconsin. We find that if the recent patterns continue, the number of Wisconsin male deer hunters will decline by more than 10~\% (55,304 hunters) in the next 10~years and an additional 18~\% (88,552 hunters) between 2020 and 2030.},

This article examined relationships between socioeconomic factors and hunting license sales in Cook County, Illinois. A principal component analysis is used to create indices aggregating census tract socioeconomic indicators. Spatial and statistical analyses using both linear regression and multinomial logistic regression explored relationships between indices and percentage of license sales for each census tract. Spatial correlation and quantitative relationships were found between the indices and hunting license sales. Models developed through this study may provide current state hunter recruitment programs with an understanding of the interaction of socioeconomic factors and hunting license sales.},
