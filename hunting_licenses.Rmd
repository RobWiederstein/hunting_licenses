# Question

Hunting as a pastime is declining in the United States. Its prolonged slump and projected decline is significant because license fees and taxes support wildlife conservation efforts.   This "user-play, user-pay" funding system--a model replicated across the globe--is jeopardizing conservation efforts as hunting declines.  [@rott] The question for consideration is whether the issuance of hunting licenses declined from 2000 to 2020 and, if so, which states showed the greatest declines.

# Background

## Wildlife as Public Good

Discuss the common law regarding wild animals. Tradgedy of the commons.

## U.S. Conservation Movement

The U.S. Conservation movement dates back to the establishment of the first national park.  In 1872, a bill creating Yellowstone National Park was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant. American sportsmen were the catalyst for the U.S. conservation movement who saw the waste of wildlife and habitat as a cause for the extinction of some species and sought to preserve others.[@reigerAmericanSportsmenOrigins2000].  Extinction of the passenger pigeon and extirpation of the bison.

The early 1900s and future president of the United States Teddy Rosevelt was a prominent spokesperson and advocate.[@reigerAmericanSportsmenOrigins2000]

The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service and charged them to "promote and regulate . . . the national parks, monuments and reservations" consistent with their purpose "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."

Finally in 1937, the Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act became law, providing funding for state agencies to carry out  conservation efforts. The Pittman–Robertson Act took over a preëxisting 11% excise tax on firearms and ammunition. Instead of going into the U.S. Treasury as it had done in the past, the money generated by the tax is instead given to the Secretary of the Interior to distribute to the states.The Secretary determines how much to give to each state based on a formula that takes into account both the area of the state and its number of licensed hunters.  The Act is widely credited for restoring the populations of white-tailed deer, wild turkeys and wood decks. Other animals like American black bears, elk, and cougars have expanded their ranges.

Due to the success of the Pittman–Robertson Act, a similar act was proposed for the protection of fish species, titled his act was titled the Federal Aid in Sports Fish Restoration Act. 



## Decline of Hunting

According to an article in Outdoor Life, hunting reached its peak in 1982 when nearly 17 million hunters purchased 28.3 million licenses. Additionally, persons born between the years 1946 and 1964, commonly referred to as the "Baby Boomers", are the largest cohort of hunters and will age out of the sport in the next 15 years.[@krebsWhyWeSuck2019]  The decline was acknowledged and projected to continue in Wisconsin deer hunters through 2030. [@winkler]

## State Role in Conservation

"Regulated hunting and trapping have been cornerstones of wildlife management in the United States since the advent of wildlife conservation," write two prominent zoologists along these lines."[@bravermanConservationHuntingTill2015] 

## Reasons for Decline

Proferred reasons for the decline include aging of hunting population, increased urbanization, change in consumer preferences . . .

## Declining Fees and Taxes

Conservation efforts are generally financed through two sources: the sale of hunting licenses from the state and the sale of firearms.  Texas, for example, funds 97% of its conservation efforts from these two sources.[@bravermanConservationHuntingTill2015]

### Federal Taxes

-  a 10 percent tax on pistols and revolvers[@26USCS4181];
-  an 11 percent tax on bows, archery equipment,and long arms;
-  an inflation adjusted tax on arrow shafts, standing at 48 cents per shaft in 2014;

"Congress requires each state and U.S. territory to develop a State Wildlife Action Plan - a proactive, comprehensive conservation strategy which examines species health and recommends actions to conserve wildlife and vital habitat before they become more rare and costly to protect."[@allianceforamericasfishwildlifeUsAllianceAmerica: 2]

"A national survey determined that each state needs an average of 26 million in new funding annually ($1.3 billion collectively) to e!ectively implement State Wildlife Action Plans to prevent species from becoming threatened or endangered."[@allianceforamericasfishwildlifeUsAllianceAmerica: 3] 

"Current funding through State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program funds only reaches a national total of 60 million on average, a shortfall of more than $1.2 billion annually."[@allianceforamericasfishwildlifeUsAllianceAmerica] 

## Recent Federal Developments

"The bipartisan Recovering America's Wildlife Act establishes a 21st century funding model for the proactive conservation of fish and wildlife. The bill will redirect 1.3 billion in existing revenues to state fish and wildlife agencies to implement their science-driven wildlife action plans, and an additional $97.5 million to tribal wildlife managers to conserve species on tribal."[@allianceforamericasfishwildlifeUsAllianceAmerica] 

States would be required to provide at least 25% in nonfederal matching funds. The source of match can be monetary or in-kind contributions originating from state or local governments or private entities such as conservation organizations, universities, businesses, private landowners, or volunteers." [@allianceforamericasfishwildlifeUsAllianceAmerica: 3]



Every five years the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife Associated Recreation is conducted.  The last survey in 2016 found that "11.5 million people 16 years and older enjoyed hunting a variety of animals within the United States. They hunted 184 million days and took 147 million trips. Hunting expenditures totaled $26.2 billion."  The survey reported that the national participation rate was four percent with significant regional variation. For example, the New England region had a two percent participation rate while the East South Central region had an eight percent participation rate.

Various explanations for the decline in hunting have been tendered. Researchers found evidence that more people opt for electronic entertainment and urban living as explainations for the decline in hunting. [@Robison]

# Data Sources

Data was retrieved from three sources: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agency, the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, & Wildlife-Associated Recreation.

## U.S. Fish and Wildlife

States require a hunting license for those harvesting game.  People who engage in hunting within the boundaries of the state they reside in require a "resident" hunting license whereas those who travel to another state require a "non-resident" license. A proxy for the popularity of the pastime is the number of hunting licenses issued by the states. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife tracks the issuance of hunting, and fishing, licenses.[@usfishwildlifeUSFishWildlife2020] Data is available via their [website](https://www.fws.gov/wsfrprograms/Subpages/LicenseInfo/Hunting.htm). Hunting license information is collected annually from (1) state, (2) territory and (3) insular areas license certifications. The data is available for the years 1963 - 2020, though it is in a pdf format.

## IPUMS Population Data

According to their [website](https://www.nhgis.org/about), "the IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) provides free online access to summary statistics and GIS files for U.S. censuses and other nationwide surveys from 1790 through the present." [@gorayIPUMSNHGIS2016].  The total population data by state was needed for the years studied so that a per capita computation could be made.[@mansonIPUMSNationalHistorical2020]
NHGIS is one of several IPUMS data integration projects located  with the Minnesota Population Center at the Institute for Social Research & Data Innovation at the University of Minnesota. [@gorayIPUMSNHGIS2016].

## National Survey FHWAR

The National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, & Wildlife-Associated Recreation (FHWAR)  reports result from interviews with U.S. residents about their fishing, hunting, and wildlife watching. The survey has been taken every five years since 1955 and potentially provides a rich and insightful look into hunting trends. Its duration exceeds that of the hunting license data that began in 1963.  [@u.s.departmentoftheinterior2016NationalSurvey] The agency describes its survey as "one of the oldest and most comprehensive continuing recreation surveys."[@u.s.departmentoftheinterior2016NationalSurvey]  The 2016 survey--the latest available, 3,931 anglers and hunters and 3,997 wildlife watchers were interviewed. [@u.s.departmentoftheinterior2016NationalSurvey](U.S. Department of the Interior et al :9)  The report was explicit that the sample size was large enough for a national conclusion, but was silent on its insight at the state-level. "The 2016 Survey's questions and methodology were similar to those used in the 2011, 2006, 2001, 1996, and 1991 Surveys. Therefore, the estimates are comparable." [@u.s.departmentoftheinterior2016NationalSurvey].

# Methodology

The analysis relied upon the statistical programming language known as `R`. [@r_core_team_r_2020]

# Conclusions

Hunting license issuance among the states for the 2000 to 2020 years declined.  This conclusion is identical to other studies using the U.S. Fish and Wildlife survey data. Possible explanations in the decline in hunting include the aging of the U.S. population, the continued migration from rural to urban settings. [@Mehmood]
