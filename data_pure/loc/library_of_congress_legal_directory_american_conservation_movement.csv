Sub-section, ""Forest Service""  (34 Stat. 1269), in the Second Session of the 59th Congress.  The entire Agriculture Appropriations bill was discussed section by section by both the House and the Senate.  Several portions of the bill were controversial and the debate was lengthy.  In the debate on the Forest section issues of concern were whether or not permanent appropriations were a good idea; what the salary ranges for professional employees and political appointees in the department ought to be; the proper course of management for the national forests and the powers of the Secretary of Agriculture; the role of forests in protecting watersheds and in irrigation; the respective rights of the Federal government, the states, and individual property owners in the western lands; and whether homesteading in forest reserves was permissible.  The main point of the bill for forest conservation was that it renamed the forest reserves as national forests and that no more national forests could be created or enlarged in the West except by Act of Congress.

There was virtually no debate on the merits of the bill.  What debate there was focused on the amendments, which mostly made small changes in wording.

Debate concerned the Secretary of the Interior's regulation of grazing in the National Parks, and whether or not National Monuments in National Forests should remain under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture; it also concerned budgetary questions and the prospect of bureaucratic growth.  The Senate wished to prohibit grazing, the House to permit it; the result was a compromise which permitted the Secretary of the Interior to regulate grazing except in Yellowstone National Park, where it was forbidden.","

Also includes statistics on the number of visitors to each national park, 1908 to 1915, and correspondence in favor of the establishment of a national park service from Secretary of the Interior Franklin K.

SUMMARY Procedure and debate surrounding the passage of S. 3057, which eventually became ""An Act Appropriating the receipts from the sale and disposal of public lands in certain States and Territories to the construction of irrigation works for the reclamation of arid lands"" (32 Stat. 388), in the First Session of the 57th Congress.  This is commonly known as the Newlands Reclamation Act.  The bill was a controversal one and debate was fierce and contentious, particularly in the House.  The principal issues were the constitutional one of the powers of the Federal government and under which clause of the Constitution was the bill lawful, and the related issue of the respective rights of the states and the Federal government, and the question of whether the irrigation of the arid West would help or harm the existing farming states.  One can find in the debate indications of regional tensions--both north-south and east-west--and of political tensions between and within parties.  There were objections to the powers given the Secretary of the Interior and to allowing one state's water to be used by another.  This legislation is thus a landmark both in conservation and water isssues and in the history of the changes in relations among the states and between the states and the Federal government.      ","

NOTESThis landmark legislation creates the first national park.  The painter and explorer George Catlin had proposed the idea that Western prairies might be preserved as ""a nation's Park"" in 1832, the same year that Congress set aside the medicinal springs of Hot Springs, Arkansas, as a public reservation (the area became a national park in 1921), and the 1864 Congressional grant of Yosemite to California (13 Stat. 325) had set an important legislative precedent.  Nevertheless, the implementation of the national park idea in this Act must be considered a conservation milestone of global significance.  The bill's immediate origins are shadowy and open to dispute (explorer and subsequent Park Superintendent Nathaniel P. Langford's well-known claim that the idea originated around a Yellowstone-area campfire in 1870 is almost certainly an ex post facto legend), but the success of the measure in Congress was indisputably due to recognition of the area's great commercial potential as a magnet for tourism--the bill was pressed by representatives of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, which stood to profit handsomely--as well as its demonstrable dearth of other exploitable natural resources.  The photographs of William Henry Jackson and the paintings of Thomas Moran, both from the Hayden Expedition of 1871, provided Congress with powerfully persuasive images of the region as a place of uniquely American wonders.

NOTESThe establishment of the Division of Economic Ornithology was a small but significant step towards involving the Federal government in wildlife study, management and protection.  In 1896, the Division was replaced by the Division (later Bureau) of Biological Survey (see 29 Stat. 99).  The formal establishment of the Division of Forestry was a key step in the development of the Federal government's role in forest conservation.  In 1901, the Division became the Bureau of Forestry (31 Stat 922); and in 1905, it became the U.S. Forest Service, with responsibility for the Federal forest reserves (see 33 Stat. 628 and 861).

SUMMARY Establishes the foundations of Yosemite National Park (in Sections 1 and 2 of the Act) and General Grant National Park (in Section 3), and adds lands to the park which became Sequoia National Park (also in Section 3), by setting aside certain tracts of land in California as forest reservations under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, directing him to establish regulations to ""provide for the preservation from injury of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said reservation[s], and their retention in their natural condition.""","

New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1973], p. 132).  However, the language of the legislation associates it also with forestry efforts, demonstrating that the preservationist and utilitarian strands of conservation thought had not yet sharply separated, a fact which perhaps facilitated the legislation's passage.  Though preservationists such as John Muir and Century Magazine editor Robert Underwood Johnson had been pressing for Yosemite's establishment as a national park, it is here designated as ""reserved forest lands,"" and it was Secretary of the Interior John W. Noble who decided to administer all of areas protected in this bill as parks (see Alfred Runte, National Parks: The American Experience [2nd ed., Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1987], pp. 58-63, for further details).

SUMMARY Repeals the Timber Culture Act of 1873, and authorizes the President to ""set apart and reserve... as public reservations"" forested portions of the public lands in any State or Territory.","
NOTESKnown as the Forest Reserve Act.  These reserves, and the President's authority to create them, established the foundation of the future National Forest system; in his autobiography Gifford Pinchot termed this Act ""the most important legislation in the history of Forestry in America.""  Recent historical investigations have demonstrated that the intent of the legislation was always mixed, anticipating both use and preservation, and that the key Congressional figure was almost certainly Representative William Steele Holman of Indiana, the probable author of Section 24.  The major incentive for forest conservation of this kind was concern for watershed protection, particularly the desire to prevent erosion and flooding by protecting forests at the headwaters and along the banks of rivers, as well as recognition of the need to protect and conserve the nation's timber supply, and to ensure the democratic development of timberlands by protecting them from exploitation by private wealth; however some, such as Secretary of the Interior John W. Noble, also saw forest reserves as a means to protect wildlife and areas of great natural beauty.  In crafting legislation for these purposes, Congress was responding to rising concerns for forest management expressed by scientists, as in the persistent efforts of the American Forestry Association and in the January, 1890 ""Memorial of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Behalf of a Proper Forest Policy;"" as well as to the groundwork of sympathetic leadership laid by conservation-minded individuals within the Federal government, such as Division of Forestry chief Bernhard Fernow and Secretary Noble; and to the advocacy of sportsmen-conservationists, such as George Bird Grinnell in the pages of the magazine Forest and Stream.  Nevertheless, the revolutionary and potentially conflict-ridden nature of this new policy is implicitly reflected in the text of the Act, for Congress declines to provide policy guidelines or specifications for the forest reservations' management. (For the history of this legislation, see especially the essays in Harold K. Steen, ed., Origins of the National Forests: A Centennial Symposium [Durham, North Carolina: Forest History Society, 1992].)

SUMMARY Establishes what became Sequoia National Park by setting apart a tract of land in California ""as a public park, or pleasure ground, for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,"" on the grounds that ""the rapid destruction of timber and ornamental trees in various parts of the United States, some of which trees are the wonders of the world on account of their size and the limited number growing, makes it a matter of importance that at least some of said forests should be preserved.""  The park's resources are therefore to be retained ""in their natural condition,"" secure from injury.","

NOTESThe provision concerning the Northern Pacific was in fact extremely favorable to the railroad, permitting it to exchange lands which were actually worthless for lumbering for unsurveyed lands elsewhere (in southwestern Washington) which contained some of the finest virgin forest remaining in the Northwest.  Some contemporary critics consequently charged that the creation of the park was merely a ruse devised to aid the railroad by its friends in Congress.  Much of the finest timberlands which the railroad obtained by this exchange were sold in 1900 to the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, solidifying its dominance of the region's lumber industry.

NOTESKnown as the Newlands Reclamation Act in honor of its chief legislative sponsor, Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada; sometimes referred to in subsequent legislation as ""the national irrigation law"" or ""the national reclamation act.""  The most important piece of legislation in the Federally-sponsored effort to create agricultural land by the management of water resources, this Act received overwhelming support from major Western business and political interests as it committed the Federal government to support and, ultimately, control of the massive irrigation projects which determined much of the subsequent environmental, political, economic, and social history of the arid West.  Though not usually considered an aspect of conservation in our own day, irrigation was understood to be an integral part of the utilitarian dimension of the conservation movement at the turn of the century.  The bureaucratic entity which administered the terms of this Act was the Reclamation Service, initially formed within the Geological Survey of the Department of the Interior under the leadership of Frederick Newell; it became an independent agency in 1907, and in 1923 was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation.

SUMMARY Authorizes an investigation by a joint committee of both Houses of Congress into the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Forestry, including public hearings, and requires that the results of the investigation be compiled in a report to Congress.","
NOTESThis investigation developed out of the acrimonious public breach between Forest Service chief Gifford Pinchot and Secretary of the Interior Richard A. Ballinger.  Though heavily politicized, the controversy had its roots in basic philosophical disagreements over the conduct of conservation policy: fundamentally, Ballinger wished to facilitate the development of natural resources by private capital in what he believed to be as fair a manner as possible, while Pinchot was primarily concerned with protecting public resources from private greed and shortsightedness through rational public ownership and management.  Smoldering conflict between the two men broke into the open when Pinchot accused Ballinger on dubious evidence of official impropriety in the handling of some coal claims in Alaska; though President Taft decided that the charges were unfounded and initially hoped to retain both men in the Administration, the accusations were made public in sensational form.  The subsequent uproar obliged Taft to fire Pinchot and to demarcate his differences with his predecessor Theodore Roosevelt on conservation policy, and led Congress to pass this Resolution.  Congress's investigation exonerated Ballinger, but Pinchot won the public relations war: the controversy severely damaged both Ballinger's reputation (he resigned in 1911) and the Taft Administration's own in the public eye.  (For a full history of this controversy, and interpretation which is particularly sympathetic to Ballinger, see James L. Penick, Jr., Progressive Politics and Conservation: The Ballinger-Pinchot Affair [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968].)

NOTESKnown as the Raker Act, in honor of its chief sponsor, Congressman John E. Raker.  The most controversial piece of legislation in the history of American conservation before 1920: the culmination of a multi-year battle which bitterly split the conservation movement between those who saw the practical use of natural resources as conservationism's essential goal (utilitarian conservationists), and those who advocated the moral necessity of preserving wilderness and scenic areas even at the cost of forgoing the use of important natural resources (preservationists).  The preservationists, led by the pioneering Scottish-American wilderness philosopher John Muir (1838-1914), lost the battle in this case, but the controversy did much to bring conservation issues into the mainstream of American public consciousness, galvanized widespread popular support for the preservationist position and in particular for the movement to create the National Park Service, and crystallized the essential ideological division within the conservation movement for most of the rest of the century.

SUMMARY Procedure and debate surrounding the passage of H.R. 24070, which eventually became ""An Act To authorize the President of the United States to make withdrawals of public lands in certain cases""  (36 Stat. 847), in the Second Session of the 61st Congress.  Debate on this bill was lengthy and contentious; on one day debate went on for seven hours.  Among the major issues was the constitutional question of the respective powers of the executive and legislative branches and whether the act gave unprecedented powers to the former.  Some objected that the act ""confers the powers of Congress on the President of the United States"" and others maintained that the Supreme Court had already upheld the President's right to withdraw lands for the public good.  The question of the respective property rights of the Federal government, the states and territories, and private owners was debated, along with the history of the treatment of public lands from the beginning of the Republic.  Issues of different treatment of the western states and territories were raised.  There was extensive debate on the meaning of ""conservation"" and who among the members was or was not a ""conservationist.""  As with other conservation measures, there were cleavages along both party and regional lines, with spirited partisan debate on some issues and strong regional differences: western resentment over restrictions of water and mining rights and eastern reminders that conservation of resources was an eastern problem as well.  Strong differences remained to the last, with one representative declaring in the House debate on the Senate's amended version of the bill: ""You will never have conservation under this bill (p. 8669).""","
